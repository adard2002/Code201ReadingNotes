## HTML Chapter 1: “Structure”
- Goes over the structure of HTML and discussing which parts mean what. Like the opening and the body of the HTML code. Also includes what the paragraph and header tags do. There are a total of 6 different sizes of header.
- Breaks down what is inside the tags such as the &lt;p&gt; tag. This is the opening tag while &lt;/p&gt; is the closing tag and this can be seen because of the forward slash in front of the p. 
- Tells us about attributes which tell us more about the elements being used. Attributes tell us more information about the contents of an element. They appear in the opening tag which are made up of two parts. the name and the value and are separated by an equals sign.

## HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup”
- This chapter tells us escape characters, which are used to tell the elements and to just show them rather than actually being used in some way. 
- DOCTYPES tell the browser which version of HTML is being used.
- You can add comments which only show up in the code and are used to help organize the code.  

## HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout”
- Tells us about headers and footers. Headers are used at the top of the page and should contain the title of the page or website. Footers are at the bottom of the page which usually contain contact info. 
- The HTML tags tell us that everything within the tags are HTML code. This usually goes at the very top of the page and closing at the very bottom of the page after the closing body tag.

## HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design”
- Tells us about wireframes. Wireframes are the bones and structure you want your webpage to look like so you know where to start from. And are very helpful organization to help the whole team know what the look is they are aiming for.
- Can color and design your page with CSS using size, color, style, etc.
