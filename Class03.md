## Chapter 3: "Lists"

### The 4 different types of Lists
1. Ordered List: This list is a list that is numbered, like when you list the steps to a recipe. &lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; This tag is going to contain &lt;li&gt; tags. Between these tags are going to be what the list content is.
2. Unordered List: This list is a list made with bullet points. This has the same way of setting up as the Ordered Lists. Just bullet points instead.
3. Definition List: This list is a list is made up of terms along with definitions for them. To create a definition list you are going to want to start with the &lt;d1&gt; opening and closing tags. Within those tags are going to be &lt;dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt; dt stands for definition term
4. Nested List: This list is a list that has a little list within another list. Put ul opening and closing tags and within those you are going to put more li tags.

### Chapter 13: "Boxes
1. Border: The border separates the edges of 2 boxes to not touch.
2. Margin: Margins are on the outside of the border.
3. Padding: Padding is the space between the contents inside and the box around it.

- You can also:
Change the border size. Border being the thin line showing the box's exterior. 
Change the border style. This can be making the border dotted, solid, dashed, double, etc.
Change the border color. 
Change the box shadows.

Border Images with stretch, repeat, and round.
- Stretch: stretches the image
- repeat: repeats the image
- round: similar to repeat but if the image tiles dont fit, it scales the tile to make it fit.
You can also: 
Border Radius: This adds a border around your text but instead of sharp corners it softens them and makes them appear more round. And you can also make circles with these.


## Chapter 2: "Basic JavaScript Instructions"
- Statements: Statements are the steps the JavaScript is going to follow. 
- Comments: Comments can be made with // (single line) or /* */ (multiple line)
- Variables: JavaScript has to store information somehow, In this case the storage is called variables. The storage is where it is going to remember the value for all sorts of stuff including: width and height. Variables also control how often a script will run. 

Different parts of Variables:
- Variable Keyword: Var is a keyword and this is used to create a variable. In order to create a Variable you must give it a name.
- Assignment Operator:: There are many different types of operators, Most common operator is the equals sign.
- Strings: Everything within single quotes is a String and will be shown either on the page in a prompt or in the console.
- Arrays: Instead of storing a single value, this stores a list of values.

## Chapter 4: "Decisions and Loops"
Operators:
- == is equal to
- === strict equal to
- != is not equal to
- !== strict not equal to
- &lt; less than
- &gt; greater than
- &lt;= greater than or equal to
- &gt;= less than or equal to

Logical Operators:
- && Logical And
- || Logical Or
- ! Logical Not

Statements: 
- if: Checks a condition to see if it evaluates true or false. 
- if else: if it results in true the first code block is executed, if it returns false then the second code block is executed.
- switch: starts with a variable (switch) value. Every time this is used it determines if the code should run if the variable matches the value.

Loops: 
- For Loops: Is used to loops through an array or items
- While Loops: This loop happens and will continue happening as long as the the condition in the parenthesis returns true. 
- Do While Loops: This loop is run whether the condition is met or not.
