They allow for users to type something in a search box. A better example would be Google's search box in the middle of the page.
### Form Controls

## Chapter 6: "Events"
### What is flow?
- Event flow: 

Event Bubbling: This goes from the most specific node and flows outward to the least specific one. 
Event Capturing: This is the opposite of what event bubbling does. this starts with the least specific one and goes in to in the most specific one.

### Why does flow matter?
The flow of events only really matters when you elements nsested inside of others, the event handlers on an elements along with one of it's relatives

### What are events?
This controls what keys on the keyboard are being pressed and how they react, same with the mouse, it has double click, single click, pressing down on the left and right mouse buttons etc.
