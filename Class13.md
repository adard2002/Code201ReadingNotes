## "The Past, Present, and Future of Local Storage for Web Applications."
### What are cookies?
The cookies we see in some sites can be used for local storage of small amounts. There are a few negatives.
1. The site is sometimes slowed down due the application constantly transmitting the same data repeatedly.
2. Sends data unencrypted over the internet
3. Cookies are limited to 4KB of data. This causes your application to slow down.

### DHTML userData
userData is way better than cookies because these allow your web page to store up to 64 KB rather than just about 4KB of data. Adobe introduced a feature in Flash 6 in 2002, this gained the name of "Flash cookies". This allowed the Flash objects to store up to 100KB of data per domain.
