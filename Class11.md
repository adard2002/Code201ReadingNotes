### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
On page SEO, in every web page there are 7 key places where people are able to search up and may be able to find your site.
1. Page Title: Appears at the very top of you page and in the browser tab at the very top
2. URL/Web Address: The name of the file is part of the URL
3. Headings: These are headings in your HTML which are the big titles in the page. These are found in a search engine sometimes.
4. Text: Depending on the text that is searched, your text on your page may come up if it's similar to what they are looking for. 
5. Link Text: Texts that lead to different links.
6. Image Alt Text: When people look up images they may find the image that is on your page and may need to go to your page to get that image.
7. Page descriptions: This is in the meta tags and such in the head tag.

Flash has been a very popular tool for creating animation, playing audio and videos in websites. The files with flash contain a .fla file extension. To use the file on the website it has to be saved in a different format known as SWF. Along with the extension of .swf of course.
