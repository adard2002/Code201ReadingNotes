## HTML&CSS-Chapter 4: "Links"
### What are links?
- Links are what takes you from one page to another

### How do you write a link?
- Links are created by using the &lt;a&gt; element. You put the link with the href attribute and anything between the opening and closing tags are what will show up on the website. Some people just put in the website link again, others put the name of the site and once clicked you are taken to that website.
- Example: &lt;a href="linkgoeshere.com">SiteNameGoesHere&lt;/a&gt;

### How do I link a file that is already in my code files?
- You would do the same but put the folder name before it. Like css/style.css.

### Relative Link Type
1. Same Folder: To link a file in the same folder you are in just use the file name.
2. Child Folder: To link a child folder, use the name of the child folder followed by forward slash and then after that the file name.
3. Grandchild Folder: Use the name of the child folder, followed by a forward slash, then the name of the grandchild folder, followed by another forward slash once again, and then the file name.
4. Parent Folder: use .../ to indicate the folder above the current one, then after that is going to be the file name.
5. Grandparent folder: Do the ../ once again to indicate you are wanting to go up two folders, like the Parent Folder but 2 foldwers up. Then follow that with the file name.

### How to link your email?
- Example: &lt;a href="mailto:adard2002@gmail.com"&gt;My Email&lt;/a&gt;

### Opening links in a new window or tab?
- Example: &lt;a href="sitelink" target="_blank">

## Article: "6 Reasons for Pair Programming"
### How does pair programming work?
There are two roles one being the Driver and the other being the Navigator. The Driver is the only one who should be typing anything on the keyboard and coding. Whereas the Navigator guides the Driver but doesn't put anything into the computer. They scan for typos and bugs.

### Why pair program?
Pair programming provides: 
1. Greater efficiency- This is because they are both looking at the code and scanning for errors, bugs, typos, etc. 
2. Engages collaboration- This is because they are focusing on the main code. And it is very understandable how it wouldn't be as engaging as when you are coding alone. You work together and keep eachother engages and focused because your communicating. This also allows for questions to ask eachother. Being no more than 15 minutes if you both are confusing you go and get help. 
3. Learning from fellow students- Students who know what they are doing and know something someone else is confused with can help someone else. It's nice being with people who are interested in the same thing as you and your all learning together. Some people may not get it as quickly as others but it's a learning experience for everyone. 
4. Social Skills- This is a great enviroment to be allow your more social side to come out. It's pretty easy to ask questions since your surrounded by people who are interested and working on the same things as you and you have so many people to ask your question to. 
5. Job interview readiness- This is also a great way to reach out in your community and get recognized as a coder. There are lots of jobs open out there that need coders and such and this reaches you out to get a job. 
6. Work enviroment readiness- This helps get your feet wet and helps you figure out if you really want to do this as a career and gets you into coding really easy. Some places allow you to work from home so there is sometimes no need to get out of your house at times. This gets you ready and prepared for what you are going into as a career.
