## Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming
### Why is the problem domain so difficult?
- This is because coding is a lot like a puzzle, you have to make sure everything works together properly, have to make sure what you typed out is correct, make sure there are no errors like in some cases you can have a space somewhere and that will mess up your whole code and not work properly. Pair programming is good for this because this is two sets of eyes looking at the same code as it is being writting and it's much easier to catch an error that way.

## Chapter 3: "Object Literals"
### What are functions?
Functions let you group statements together to perform a specific task. Functions can also be used multiple times and be reused. To use a function you must give it a name. Everything within the curly braces are called a code block. In order to call that function and actually use it you have to put the name of the function along with a set of parenthesis and a semi colon. You will put this at the bottom of your code with the function name. You can also get multiple values from just one function. By typing return just before the closing curly brace you can put something called return and the var name. This is make it so the answer or result will return in the console.
### Arrays
Functions allow you to make a list of objects and be able to call those and give them a name. you can have a list of a, b, and c and when that is called you should get something like the values of a, b, and c. The arrays are one of the first things you will put in your code block. With var you can also make a string that returns 


## Chapter 5: "Document Object Model"

### What is the DOM
This is a layout of all of the elements within an html code. This can look like a type of tree. This can show you that there are attributes in some of the element nodes, same with the text nodes and text that are in elements. This makes it way easier to see whats all in what in an html document.

### selecting elements using class 
There are multiple ways of selecting elements using class. This can be done by adding the attribute, or by tag name, or what might be used the most is CSS selectors.
